    "The partial dependence (`PD`) plot proposed by [J.H. Friedman (2001)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-29/issue-5/Greedy-function-approximation-A-gradient-boostingmachine/10.1214/aos/1013203451.full)[[1]](#References) , is a method of visualizing the marginal effect that one or two features have on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model. By inspecting the `PD` plots, one can understand whether the relation between a feature/pair of features is, for example, a simple linear or quadratic relation, whether it presents a monotonically increasing or decreasing trend, or reveal a more complex response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the mathematical formulation of the `PD`, we first introduce some notation. Consider $\\mathcal{F}$ to be the set of all features, $S$ be a set of features of interest (i.e. $S \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$) that we want to compute the marginal effect for, and $C$ be their complement (i.e. $C = \\mathcal{F} \\setminus S$). It is important to note that the subset $S$ is not only restricted to one or two features as mentioned in the previous paragraph, but can be any subset of the set $\\mathcal{F}$. In practice, though, due to visualization reasons, we will not analyze more than two features at the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a black-box model, $f$, we are ready to define the partial dependence for a set of features $S$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    f_{S}(x_S) = \\mathbb{E}_{X_C} [f(x_S, X_C)] = \\int f(x_S, X_C) d\\mathbb{P}(X_C),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we denoted random variables by capital letters (e.g., $X_C$), realizations by lowercase letters (e.g. $x_S$), and $\\mathbb{P}(X_C)$ the probability distribution/measure over the features set C. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, to approximate the integral above, we compute the average over a reference dataset. Formally, let us consider a reference dataset $\\mathcal{X} = \\{x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, ..., x^{(n)}\\}$. The `PD` for the set $S$ can be approximated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_{S}(x_S) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_S, x_{C}^{(i)}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words, to compute the marginal effect of the feature values $x_S$, we query the model on synthetic instances created from the concatenation of $x_S$ with the feature values $x_C^{(i)}$ from the reference dataset, and averaging the model responses. Already from the computation we can identify a major limitation of the method. The `PD` computation assumes feature independence (i.e., features are not correlated) which is a strong and quite restrictive assumption and usually does not hold in practice. A classic example of positively correlated features is *height* and *weight*. If $S = \\{\\text{height}\\}$ and $C=\\{\\text{weight}\\}$, the independence assumption will create an unrealistic synthetic instance, by combining values of *height* and *weight* that are not correlated (e.g. $\\text{height} = 1.85\\text{m}$ - height of an adult - and $\\text{weight} = 30 \\text{kg}$ - weight of a child). This limitation can be addressed by the [Accumulated Local Effects](../methods/ALE.ipynb)[[2]](#References) (`ALE`) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the `ALE` can handle correlated features, the `PD` still has some advantages beyond their simple and intuitive definition. The `PD` can directly be extended to categorical features. For each category of a feature, one can compute the `PD` by setting all data instance to have the same category and following the same averaging strategy over the reference dataset (i.e. replace features $C$ with feature values from the reference, compute the response, and average all the responses). Note that `ALE` requires by definition the feature values to be ordinal, which might not be the case for all categorical features. Depending on the context, there exist some methods that allow the `ALE` to be extended to categorical features for which we recommend the [ALE chapter](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/ale.html) from the [Interpretable machine learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)[[3]](#References) book, as further reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "We illustrate `PD` for the simple case of interpreting a linear regression model and demonstrate that it correctly results in showing a linear relationship between the features and the response. To formally prove the linear relationship, consider the following linear regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + ... \\beta_{|\\mathcal{F}|} x_{|\\mathcal{F}|}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Without loss of generality, we can assume the features of interest come first in the equation above and the rest of the features at the end. We can rewrite the above equation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{S_1} + ... + \\beta_{|S|} x_{S_{|S|}} + \\beta_{|S| + 1} x_{C_{1}} + ... + \\beta_{|S| + |C|} x_{C_{|C|}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S_{i}$ and $C_{i}$ represent features in $S$ and $C$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the definition of `PD`, we obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f_S(x_{S}) &= \\mathbb{E}_{X_C}[f(x_S, X_C)] \\\\\n",
    "&  =  \\mathbb{E}_{X_C}[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{S_1} + ... + \\beta_{\\lvert S\\rvert} x_{S_{\\lvert S\\rvert}} + \\beta_{\\lvert S\\rvert + 1} x_{C_{1}} + ... + \\beta_{\\lvert S\\rvert + \\lvert C\\rvert} x_{C_{\\lvert C\\rvert}}] \\\\\n",
